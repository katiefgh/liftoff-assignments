## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This project will feature a compendium of Dungeons and Dragons knowledged structured to help a user find the class and archetype most suitable to their desired playstyle. The user will take a quiz, which will give the program information to filter down class results. Afterwards, the program should return the class that scored the most points based on the user answers, as well as return the race that maximizes ability score point potential.

This quiz will look at base classes as well as the archetypes in the player's handbook and Xanathar's Guide to everything. If there is time, I would also like to have a spell compendium that helps clerics, druids, and every other class that needs to prepare spells have a quick tool that finds relevant spells based on the criteria they provide, but I don't think that would be MVP
